<h3 class="section">1.1 How to read this document</h3>

<p>This is essentially a reference document,
but its early chapters lay out concepts
essential to the others.
Readers will usually want to read the
chapters up and including
<a href="#Introduction-to-the-external-interface">Introduction to the external interface</a>
in order.
Otherwise, they should follow their interests.

<a name="Prerequisites-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.2 Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This document is very far from self-contained.
It assumes the following:
</p><ul>
<li> The reader knows the C programming language
at least well
enough to understand function prototypes and return values.
</li><li> The reader
has read the documents for one of Libmarpa&rsquo;s upper layers.
As of this writing, the only such layer is <code>Marpa::R2</code>
or <code>Marpa::R3</code>,
in Perl.
</li><li> The reader knows some parsing theory.
See <a href="#Parsing-theory">Parsing theory</a>.
</li></ul>

<a name="Parsing-theory"></a>
<a name="Parsing-theory-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.3 Parsing theory</h3>

<p>This document assumes some acquaintance
with parsing theory.
The reader&rsquo;s
level of knowledge is probably adequate
if he can
answer the following questions,
either immediately or after a little reflection.
</p><ul>
<li> What is a BNF rule?
</li><li> What is a Marpa sequence rule?
</li><li> As a reminder,
Marpa&rsquo;s sequence rules are implemented
as left recursions.
What does that mean?
</li><li> Take a Marpa sequence rule at random.
What does it look like when rewritten in BNF?
</li><li> What does the sequence look like when rewritten
in BNF as a right-recursion?
</li></ul>

<a name="About-Libmarpa"></a>
<a name="About-Libmarpa-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 About Libmarpa</h2>

<p>Libmarpa implements the Marpa parsing algorithm.
Marpa is named
after the legendary 11th century Tibetan translator,
Marpa Lotsawa.
In creating Marpa,
I depended heavily on previous work by Jay Earley,
Joop Leo,
John Aycock and Nigel Horspool.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa implements the entire Marpa algorithm.
This library does
the necessary grammar preprocessing, recognizes the input,
and produces parse trees.
It also supports the ordering, iteration
and evaluation of the parse
trees.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa is very low-level.
For example, it has no strings.
Rules, symbols, and token values are all represented
by integers.
This, of course, will not suffice for many applications.
Users will very often want
names for the symbols, non-integer values for
tokens, or both.
Typically, applications will use arrays to
translate Libmarpa&rsquo;s integer ID&rsquo;s to strings or other
values as required.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa also does <strong>not</strong> implement most of the semantics.
Libmarpa does have an evaluator (called a &ldquo;valuator&rdquo;),
but it does <strong>not</strong>
manipulate the stack directly.
Instead, Libmarpa,
based on its traversal of the parse tree,
passes optimized step by step stack manipulation
instructions to the upper layer.
These instructions indicate the token or rule involved,
and the proper location for the true token value or
the result of the rule evaluation.
For rule evaluations, the instructions include the stack location
of the arguments.
</p>
<p>Marpa requires most semantics to be
implemented in the application.
This allows the application total flexibility.
It also puts
the application is in a much better position to prevent errors,
to catch errors at runtime or,
failing all else,
to successfully debug the logic.

<a name="Major-objects"></a>
<a name="Major-objects-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Major objects</h3>

<p>The classes of
Libmarpa&rsquo;s object system fall into two types:
major and numbered.
These are the Libmarpa&rsquo;s major classes,
in sequence.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Configuration:
A configuration object is
a thread-safe way to hold configuration variables,
as well as the return code from failed attempts
to create grammar objects.
</li><li> Grammar:
A grammar object contains rules and symbols,
with their properties.
</li><li> Recognizer:
A recognizer object reads input.
</li><li> Bocage:
A bocage object is a collection of
parse trees, as found by a recognizer.
Bocages are similar to parse forests.
</li><li> Ordering:
An ordering object
is an ordering of the trees
in a bocage.
</li><li> Tree:
A tree object is a bocage iterator.
</li><li> Value:
A value object is a tree iterator.
Iteration of tree using a value object
produces &ldquo;steps&rdquo;.
These &ldquo;steps&rdquo; are
instructions to
the application on how 
to evaluate the semantics,
and how to manipulate the stack.
</li></ul>


<p>The major objects have one letter abbreviations,
which are used frequently.
These are, in the standard sequence,
</p>
<ul>
<li> Configuration:  C
</li><li> Grammar:  G
</li><li> Recognizer: R
</li><li> Bocage: B
</li><li> Ordering: O
</li><li> Tree: T
</li><li> Value: V
</li></ul>

<hr>
<a name="Time-objects"></a>
<a name="Time-objects-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Time objects</h3>

<p>All of Libmarpa&rsquo;s major classes,
except the configuration class,
are &ldquo;time&rdquo; classes.
Except for objects in the grammar class,
all time objects are created from another time
object.
Each time object is created from a time object
of the class before it in the sequence.
A recognizer cannot be created without a precomputed grammar;
a bocage cannot be created without a recognizer;
and so on.
</p>
<p>When one time object is used to create a second
time object,
the first time object is the <em>parent object</em>
and the second time object is the <em>child object</em>.
For example, when a bocage is created from a
recognizer,
the recognizer is the parent object,
and the bocage is the child object.
</p>
<p>Grammars have no parent object.
Every other time object has exactly one parent object.
Value objects have no child objects.
All other time objects can have any number of children,
from zero up to a number determined by memory or
some other machine-determined limit.
</p>
<p>Every time object has a <em>base grammar</em>.
A grammar object is its own base grammar.
The base grammar of a recognizer is the grammar
that it was created with.
The base grammar of any other time object is the base
grammar of its parent object.
For example,
the base grammar of a bocage is the base
grammar of the recognizer that it was created
with.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Reference-counting"></a>
<a name="Reference-counting-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Reference counting</h3>

<p>Every object in a &ldquo;time&rdquo; class
has its own, distinct, lifetime,
which is controlled by the object&rsquo;s reference count.
Reference counting follows the usual practice.
Contexts which take a share of the
&ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of an object
increase the reference count by 1.
When a context relinquishes its share of
the ownership of an object, it decreases the reference
count by 1.
</p>
<p>Each class of time object has a &ldquo;ref&rdquo; and an &ldquo;unref&rdquo;
method, to be used by those contexts which need to
explicitly increment and decrement the reference count.
For example, the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; method for the grammar class is
<code>marpa_g_ref()</code>
and the &ldquo;unref&rdquo; method for the grammar class is
<code>marpa_g_unref()</code>.
</p>
<p>Time objects do not have explicit destructors.
When the reference count of a time object reaches
0, that time object is destroyed.
</p>
<p>Much of the necessary reference counting
is performed automatically.
The context calling the constructor of a time object
does not need to explicitly increase the reference
count, because
Libmarpa time objects are
always created with a reference count of 1.
</p>
<p>Child objects &ldquo;own&rdquo; their parents,
and when a child object is successfully created,
the reference count of its parent object is
automatically incremented to reflect this.
When a child object is destroyed, it
automatically decrements the reference count of its parent.
</p>
<p>In a typical application, a calling context needs only
to remember
to &ldquo;unref&rdquo; each time object that it creates,
once it is finished with that time object.
All other reference decrements and increments are taken
care of automatically.
The typical application never needs to explicitly
call one of the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; methods.
</p>
<p>More complex applications may find it convenient
to have one or more contexts share ownership of objects
created in another context.
These more complex situations
are the only cases in which the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; methods
will be needed.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Numbered objects</h3>

<p>In addition to its major, &ldquo;time&rdquo; objects, Libmarpa also has
numbered objects.
Numbered objects do not have lifetimes of their own.
Every numbered object belongs to a time object,
and is destroyed with it.
Rules and symbols are numbered objects.
Tokens values are another class of numbered

<a name="The-traditional-model-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 The traditional model</h4>

<p>In traditional Earley parsers, the concept of location is very simple.
Locations are numbered from 0 to <var>n</var>, where <var>n</var> is the length of
the input.
Every location has an Earley set, and vice versa.
Location 0 is the start location.
Every location after the start location has exactly one input token
associated with it.
</p>
<p>Some applications
do not fit this traditional input model &mdash; 
natural language processing requires ambiguous tokens,
for example.
Libmarpa allows a wide variety of alternative input models.
</p>
<p>This document assumes that the reader knows the concepts
behind Libmarpa&rsquo;s
alternative input models, either from the documentation
of a higher level interface, such as
<code>Marpa::XS</code>,
<code>Marpa::R2</code>,
or <code>Marpa::R3</code>,
or from Marpa&rsquo;s
<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9_mR_M2zOc4Ni1zSW5IYzk3TGc/edit?usp=sharing">theory document</a>.
</p>
<p>As a reminder,
in Libmarpa a location is called a <em>earleme</em>.
The number of an Earley set is the <em>ID of the Earley set</em>,
or its <em>ordinal</em>.
In the traditional model, the ordinal of an Earley set and
its earleme are always exactly the same, but in Libmarpa
they will be different.

<a name="The-earleme-variables"></a>
<a name="The-earleme-variables-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 The earleme variables</h4>

<p>The important earleme variables are the current earleme, the furthest earleme
and the latest earleme.
The <em>current earleme</em> is the earleme that Libmarpa is currently working on.
More specifically, it is the one at which new tokens will <strong>start</strong>.
Since tokens are never zero length, a new token will always end after the
current earleme.
The current earleme is initially earleme 0.
Every call to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> advances the
current earleme by 1.
</p>
<p>The <em>furthest earleme</em> is the highest numbered (and therefore &ldquo;furthest&rdquo;)
earleme at which a token ends.
The furthest earleme is initially earleme 0.
With every call to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>, the end of the token
it adds is calculated.
A token ends at the earleme location <var>current</var>+<var>length</var>,
where <var>current</var> is the current earleme,
and <var>length</var> is the length of the newly added token.
After a call to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the furthest earleme is its value before the call,
or <var>current</var>+<var>length</var>,
whichever is greater.
</p>
<p>The <em>latest earleme</em> is the earleme of the latest
Earley set.
The <em>latest Earley set</em> is the last Earley set completed.
This is always the highest numbered Earley set.
If there is an Earley set at the current earleme,
it is the latest Earley set and the latest earleme
is equal to the current earleme.
There is never an Earley set after the current earleme.
</p>
<p>After every call to the <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> method
that adds a token,
the value of the latest earleme is 
same as the value of the current earleme.
After every call to the <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> method
that does <strong>not</strong> add a token,
the value of the latest earleme is unchanged
from its value before the call.

<a name="The-significances-of-the-earleme-variables-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.3 The significances of the earleme variables</h4>

<p>The current earleme tracks the advance of the recognizer through the input.
Input tokens always start at the current earleme.
An application can advance past the current earleme,
by calling <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>, which
increments the current earleme by 1.
After initialization,
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> is
the only way to manipulate the value of the current earleme.
</p>
<p>The furthest earleme tracks how &ldquo;far out&rdquo; tokens can be found.
In the standard input model, calling 
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> after each
<code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> call is sufficient to process
all inputs,
and the furthest earleme&rsquo;s value
can be typically be ignored.
In alternative input models, if tokens have lengths greater than
1, calling
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> once after the last token
is read may not be enough to ensure that all tokens have been processed.
To ensure that all tokens have been processed,
an application must advance the current earleme
by calling <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
until the current earleme is equal to the furthest earleme.
</p>
<p>The lastest earleme is the earleme of the last Earley set.
The latest earleme is different from the current earleme if and only if
there is no Earley set at the current earleme.
A different end of parsing can be specified,
but by default, parsing is of the input
in the range
from earleme 0 to the latest earleme.

<p>All input models have the same initial values.
Initially the current, latest and furthest earleme
are always earleme 0.
</p>
<p>Understanding the
settings of current, latest and furthest earleme is

and for this reason the next sections will go
through the possibilities carefully.
The presentation will start with the most traditional

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.5 The standard model of input</h4>

<p>In the standard model of input,
calls to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
and <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> are
made in pairs.
There is, first, exactly one call 
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
and it is for a token with length 1.
Following it must be a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
For an input of length <var>n</var>, there will be
exactly <var>n</var> such paired calls.
</p>
<p>Suppose, in the standard model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call was <var>c</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>Because this is the standard model,
this means that we also know that
</p><ul>
<li> The latest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>In that case,
after the call to 
<code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following will be true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme will still be <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The latest earleme will still be <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme will be <var>c</var>+1.
</li></ul>

<p>Suppose, in the standard model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call is <var>c</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>Because this is the standard model,
this means that we also know that
</p><ul>
<li> The latest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme before the call was <var>c+1</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>In that case,
after the call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
the current, latest and furthest earlemes will
be the same.
Specifically,
the following will be true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme will be advanced to <var>c+1</var>.
</li><li> The latest earleme will be advanced to <var>c+1</var>.

<a name="Ambiguous-input"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.6 Ambiguous input</h4>

<p>As a first loosening of the standard model,
we no longer require calls to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
to be paired with calls to
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
Instead,
we allow a series of one or more calls
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
before each call to
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
We still require that there be at least one call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
before each call to
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
and we still require that all tokens have 
a length of 1.
</p>
<p>In the ambiguous input model, the behavior of the current,
latest and furthest earlemes are exactly
as described for the standard model, with one minor
exception:
Where the current earleme is <var>c</var>,
and a call to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> is not the first
of a series,
the value of the furthest earleme before the call will be
<var>c</var>+1.

<hr>
<a name="Variable-length-tokens"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.7 Variable length tokens</h4>

<p>Our next loosening of the restrictions is to allow
variable length tokens.
That is, instead of requiring that all tokens
be of length 1,
we allow tokens to be of length 1 or longer.
This does change the behavior of the earleme variables.
</p>
<p>Suppose, in the variable length token model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call was <var>c</var>.
In this model, this means that
the latest earleme before the call is also <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme before the call was <var>old_f</var>.
</li><li> The length of the token is <var>length</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>In that case,
after the call to 
<code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following will be true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current and latest earlemes will still be <var>c</var>.
The current and latest earlemes are never changed by a call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme will be either <var>old_f</var> or
 <var>c</var>+<var>length</var>, whichever was greater.
</li></ul>

<p>Suppose, in the variable length token model that,
for a call

the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call is <var>c</var>.
In this model, this means that

<a name="The-generalized-model-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.8 The generalized model</h4>

<p>To fully generalize the input model,
we now need to remove only one restriction.
We now allow empty earlemes &mdash; earlemes with
no tokens and no Earley set.
For the generalized input model,
the effect on the earleme variables of
a call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> is exactly
the same as it is for the variable length input model.
The effect on the earleme variables of a call to
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> depends on
whether or not that call creates an empty earleme.
A call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>
creates an empty earleme if and only if
it falls into one of these two cases:
</p><ul>
<li> There has been no call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> since
recognizer initialization.
</li><li> There has been no call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> since
the previous call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Suppose, in the generalized input model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>
that creates an empty earleme,
the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call is <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The latest earleme before the call is <var>old_l</var>.
</li><li> The furthest earleme before the call is <var>old_f</var>.
</li></ul>
<p>In that case,
after the call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
the following will be true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme will be advanced to <var>c+1</var>.
</li><li> The latest earleme will remain at <var>old_l</var>.
This means that the latest earleme will be less than
the current earleme.
</li><li> The furthest earleme will remain at <var>old_f</var>.
The furthest earleme is never changed by a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Suppose, in the generalized input model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>
that does not create an empty earleme,
the following is true:
</p><ul>
<li> The current earleme before the call is <var>c</var>.
</li><li> The latest earleme before the call is <var>old_l</var>.

<p>At this point, the most generalized input model has been

Here are some useful facts about the earleme variables that will always be the case,
no matter which of the input models is in use.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The current earleme is always greater than

<p>If the parser is not exhausted,
the following will always be true,
no matter which of the input models is in use.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The furthest earleme is greater than
or equal to the current earleme.
</li></ul>

<p>In an exhausted parser, the following will always be true,

<a name="Terminals"></a>
<a name="Terminals-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Terminals</h3>

<p>A terminal symbol is a symbol which
may appear in the input.
Traditionally,
all LHS symbols, as well as
the start symbol, must be non-terminals.
This is Marpa&rsquo;s behavior, by default.
</p>
<p>Marpa allows the user to eliminate the distinction
between terminals and non-terminals.
In this, it
differs from traditional parsers.
Libmarpa
can arrange for a terminal
to appear on the LHS of one or more rules,
or for a terminal to be the start symbol.
However,
since terminals can never be zero length,
it is a logical contradiction for a nulling
symbol to also be a terminal
and Marpa does not allow it.
</p>
<p>Token values are <code>int</code>&rsquo;s.
Libmarpa does nothing with token values except accept
them from the application and return them during
parse evaluation.

<hr>
<a name="Semantics"></a>
<a name="Semantics-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">5 Semantics</h2>

<p>Libmarpa handling of semantics is unusual.
Most semantics are left up to the application,
but Libmarpa guides them.
Specifically, the application is expected to maintain the evaluation
stack.
Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator provides instructions on how to handle the stack.
Libmarpa&rsquo;s stack handling instructions
are called &ldquo;steps&rdquo;.
For example, a Libmarpa step might tell the application that the value
of a token needs to go into a certain stack position.
Or a Libmarpa step might tell the application that a rule is to be evaluated.
For rule evalution, Libmarpa will tell the application where the operands
are to be found,
and where the result must go.
</p>
<p>The detailed discussion of
Libmarpa&rsquo;s handling of semantics is in the reference chapters
of this document,
under the appropriate methods and classes.
The most extensive discussion of the semantics
is in the section that deals with the methods of the value time class.
See <a href="#Value-methods">Value methods</a>.

<hr>
<a name="Threads"></a>
<a name="Threads-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">6 Threads</h2>

<p>Libmarpa is thread-safe,
given circumstances as described below.
The Libmarpa methods are not reentrant.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa is C89-compliant.
It uses no global data,
and calls only the routines
that are defined in the C89 standard
and that can be made thread-safe.
In most modern implementations,
the default C89 implementation is thread-safe
to the extent possible.
But the C89 standard does not require thread-safety,
and even most modern environments allow the user
to turn thread safety off.
To be thread-safe, Libmarpa must be compiled
and linked in an environment that provides
thread-safety.
</p>
<p>While Libmarpa can be used safely across
multiple threads,
a Libmarpa grammar cannot be.
Further, a Libmarpa time object can
only be used safely in the same thread
as its base grammar.
This is because all
time objects with the same base grammar share data
from that base grammar.
</p>
<p>To work around this limitation,
the same grammar definition can be
used to a create a new
Libmarpa grammar
time object in each thread.
If there is sufficient interest, future versions of
Libmarpa could allow thread-safe
cloning of grammars and other
time objects.

<a name="Fatal-Errors"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">7 Fatal Errors</h2>

<p>Libmarpa avoids fatal errors,
leaving that decision up to the application,
with one exception.
Currently, if <code>malloc</code> fails to allocate memory,
Libmarpa terminates the program with a fatal error.
</p>
<p>While this is in keeping with current practice,
future versions of Libmarpa are likely to both allow
an alternative memory allocator to be specified,
and to allow the user to specifier a handler to
be called when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

<h3 class="section">8.1 About the overviews</h3>

<p>The reference sections for each major class begin with an overview.
These sections name the
most important Libmarpa methods
in the order in which they are typically used,
and very briefly describe their purpose.
The overviews are intended as &ldquo;cheat sheets&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The overview sections often speak of
an &ldquo;archetypal&rdquo; application.
The archetypal Libmarpa application
implements a complete logic flow,
starting with the creation of a grammar,
and proceeding all the way
to the return of the final result from a value object.
In the archetypal Libmarpa application,
the grammar, input and semantics are
all small but non-trivial.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Return-values"></a>
<a name="Return-values-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">8.2 Return values</h3>

<p>Return values are discussed method by method,
but some general practices are worth
mentioning.
For methods that return an integer,
Libmarpa usually reserves -1 for special purposes,
such as indicating loop termination in an iterator.
In Libmarpa, methods usually indicate failure
by returning -2.
Any result greater than -2 usually indicates success.
</p>
<p>If a method returns an pointer value,
<code>NULL</code> usually indicates failure.
Any other result usually indicates success.
</p>
<p>On failure, a Libmarpa method always sets
the error code.
On success, a Libmarpa method may take
one of three actions:
</p><ul>
<li> Set
an informational error code.
</li><li> Leave
the error code as it is.
</li><li> Reset the error code to <code>MARPA_ERROR_NONE</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Which of the three actions the method
takes on success
should be regarded as unspecified,
unless stated in the description of the method
in this document.
If a method sets an informational error code on
success, that will always be stated in
its description, and the description will 
specify,
for each informational error code,
the specific error code value,
the circumstances under which it is set,
and what return values will accompany it.
</p>
<p>Informational error codes are set
because some applications may find them convenient.
Typically, informational error codes are redundant information,
which may be ignored.
</p>
<p>A method can have many reasons for
failing, and many of the reasons
for failure are common to
large number of methods.
Full descriptions of the error codes
that are returned by the external methods
are given in their own section.
See <a href="#External-error-codes">External error codes</a>.

<hr>
<a name="Naming-conventions"></a>
<a name="Naming-conventions-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">8.3 Naming conventions</h3>

<p>Methods in Libmarpa follow a strict naming convention.
All methods have a name beginning with <code>marpa_</code>,
if they are part of the
external interface.
If an external method is not a static method,
its name is prefixed with one of 
<code>marpa_c_</code>,
<code>marpa_g_</code>,
<code>marpa_r_</code>,
<code>marpa_b_</code>,
<code>marpa_o_</code>,
<code>marpa_t_</code> or
<code>marpa_v_</code>,
where the single letter between underscores
is one of the Libmarpa major class abbreviations.
The letter indicates which class
the method belongs to.
</p>
<p>Methods that are exported,
but that are part of
the internal interface,
begin with <code>_marpa_</code>.
Methods that are part of the internal interface
(often called &ldquo;internal methods&rdquo;)
are subject to change and are intended for use
only by Libmarpa&rsquo;s developers.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa reserves the <code>marpa_</code>
and <code>_marpa_</code> prefixes for itself,
with all their capitalization variants.
All Libmarpa names visible outside the package
will begin with a capitalization variant
of one of these two prefixes.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Configuration methods</h2>

<p>The configuration object is intended for future extensions.
These may
allow the application to override Libmarpa&rsquo;s memory allocation
and fatal error handling without resorting to global
variables, and therefore in a thread-safe way.
Currently, the only function of the <code>Marpa_Config</code>
class is to give <code>marpa_g_new()</code>
a place to put its error code.
</p>
<p><code>Marpa_Config</code> is Libmarpa&rsquo;s only &ldquo;major&rdquo;
class which is not a time class.
There is no constructor or destructor, although
<code>Marpa_Config</code> objects <strong>do</strong> need to be initialized
before use.
Aside from its own accessor,
<code>Marpa_Config</code> objects are only used by <code>marpa_g_new</code>
and no reference to their location is not kept
in any of Libmarpa&rsquo;s time objects.
The intent is to that it be convenient
to have them in memory that might be deallocated
soon after <code>marpa_g_new</code> returns.
For example, they could be put on the stack.

<p>Error codes are usually kept in the base grammar,
which leaves <code>marpa_g_new()</code> no place to put
its error code on failure.
Objects of
the <code>Marpa_Config</code> class provide such a place.
<var>p_error_string</var> is reserved for use by

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h3 class="section">11.1 Overview</h3>

<p>An archetypal application has a grammar.
To create a grammar, use the <code>marpa_g_new()</code> method.
When a grammar is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
<code>marpa_g_unref()</code> method.
</p>
<p>To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more symbols.
To create symbols, use the
<code>marpa_g_symbol_new()</code> method.
</p>
<p>To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more rules.
To create rules, use the
<code>marpa_g_rule_new()</code> and
<code>marpa_g_sequence_new()</code> methods.
</p>
<p>For non-trivial parsing,
one or more of the symbols must be terminals.
To mark a symbol as a terminal,
use the
<code>marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()</code> method.
</p>
<p>To be precomputed,
a grammar must have exactly one start symbol.
To mark a symbol as the start symbol,
use the
<code>marpa_g_start_symbol_set()</code> method.
</p>
<p>Before parsing with a grammar, it must be precomputed.
To precompute a grammar,
use the
<code>marpa_g_precompute()</code> method.

</p>
<p>Unless the application calls <code>marpa_c_error</code>,
Libmarpa will not reference the location

The <var>configuration</var> argument may be <code>NULL</code>,

<p>The <code>marpa_g_force_valued</code> forces all the
symbols in a grammar to be &ldquo;valued&rdquo;.
The opposite of a valued symbol is one about whose value
you do not care.
This distinction has been made in the past in hope
of gaining efficiencies at evaluation time.
Current thinking is that the gains do not repay the extra
complexity.

<p>These methods, respectively, set

To be used as an input symbol
in the <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> method,
a symbol must be a terminal.
This function flags symbol <var>sym_id</var> as a terminal if
<var>value</var> is 1,
or flags it as a non-terminal if <var>value</var> is 0.
</p>
<p>Once set to a value with the

the terminal status of a symbol is &ldquo;locked&rdquo; at that value.
A subsequent call to 
<code>marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()</code> that attempts

of <var>sym_id</var> to a value different from its current one
will fail.

</p>
<p>By default, a symbol is a terminal if and only if it
does not appear on the LHS of any rule.
An attempt to flag a nulling symbol
as a terminal will cause a failure,

<dd><p>Adds a new sequence rule to grammar <var>g</var>.
The ID of the new sequence rule will be a non-negative integer,
which is unique to that rule.
Sequence rules and BNF rules are numbered in the same series,
so that a BNF rule will never have the same rule ID as a sequence
rule, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>The sequence is <var>lhs_id</var>,
and the item to be repeated in the sequence is <var>rhs_id</var>.
The sequence must be repeated at least <var>min</var> times,
where <var>min</var> is 0 or 1.
If <var>separator_id</var> is non-negative,
it is a separator symbol.
</p>
<p>If <code>flags &amp; MARPA_PROPER_SEPARATION</code> is non-zero,
separation is &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, that is,
a trailing separator is not allowed.
The term <em>proper</em> is based on the idea that
properly-speaking, separators should actually separate items.
</p>
<p>Some higher-level Marpa interfaces offer the ability to
discard separators in the semantics,
and in fact will do this by default.
At the Libmarpa level, sequences always &ldquo;keep
separators&rdquo;.
It is up to the programmer to arrange
to discard separators,
if that is what is desired.
</p>
<p>The sequence RHS, or item,
is restricted to a single symbol,
and that symbol cannot be nullable.
If <var>separator_id</var> is a symbol, it also cannot
be a nullable symbol.
Nullables on the RHS of sequences are restricted
because they lead to highly ambiguous grammars.
Grammars of this kind are allowed by Libmarpa, but
they must be expressed using BNF rules, not sequence rules.
This is for two reasons:
First, sequence optimizations would not work
in the presence of nullables.
Second, since it is not completely clear what
an application intends
when it asks for a sequence of identical items,
some of which are nullable,
the user&rsquo;s intent can be more clearly expressed
directly in BNF.
</p>
<p>The LHS symbol cannot be the LHS of any other rule,
whether a BNF rule or a sequence rule.
On an attempt to create an sequence rule with a duplicate
LHS,
<code>marpa_g_sequence_new()</code> fails,
setting the error code to
<code>MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE</code>.
</p>
<p>Sequence rules do not add to the classes of grammar parsed
by Libmarpa &mdash;
a sequence can always be written as BNF rules.
When a rule is created
with the <code>marpa_g_sequence_new()</code> method,
Libmarpa will understand that it is a sequence,
and will optimize accordingly.
The speedup is often considerable.

event whenever the symbol is nulled.
A symbol is said to be <strong>nulled</strong>
when a zero length instance of that symbol
is recognized.
</p>
<p>For nulled events to occur, the symbol must be marked
as a nulled event symbol.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event_set()</code> function
marks symbol <var>sym_id</var> as a nulled event symbol
if <var>value</var> is 1,

it as a nulled event symbol if <var>value</var> is 0.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event()</code> method
returns the current value of the nulled event marking

</p>
<p>Marking a nulled event sets its activation status to on.
Unmarking a nulled event sets its activation status to off.
The nulled event marking cannot be changed once
the grammar is precomputed.
</p>
<p>If a nulled event is marked,
its activation status can be changed using the
<code>marpa_g_nulled_symbol_activate()</code> method.
Note that, if a symbol is marked as a nulled event symbol
in the recognizer,
its nulled event can be deactivated
and reactivated in the recognizer.
</p>
<p>As a reminder, a symbol instance is a symbol
at a specific location in the input,
and with a specific length.
Also, whenever a nulled symbol instance is
recognized at a location, it is acceptable
at that location,
and vice versa.
</p>
<p>When a symbol instance is recognized at a location,
it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event,
but never both.
A symbol instance of zero length,
when recognized at a location,
generates a nulled event at that location,
and does not generate a completion event.
A symbol instance of non-zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a completion event at that location,
and does not generate a nulled event.
</p>
<p>When a symbol instance is acceptable at a location,
it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event,
but never both.
A symbol instance of zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a nulled event at that location,
and does not generate a prediction event.
A symbol instance of non-zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a prediction event at that location,
and does not generate a nulled event.
</p>
<p>While it is not possible for
a <strong>symbol instance</strong>
to generate both a nulled event and
a completion event at a location,
it is quite possible that
a <strong>symbol</strong> might generate
both kinds of event at that location.
This is because multiple instances
of the same symbol may be recognized at
a given location,
and these instances will have
different lengths.
If one instance is recognized at a given location
as zero length and
a second, non-zero-length,
instance is recognized at the same location,
the first will generate only nulled events,
while the second will generate only completion events.
For similar reasons,
while a <strong>symbol instance</strong> will never
generate both a null event and a prediction
event at a location,
multiple instances of the same symbol
may do so.
</p>
<p>Zero length derivations can be ambiguous.
When a zero length symbol is recognized,
all of its zero-length derivations are also considered to be
recognized.
</p>
<p>The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event_set()</code> method will
mark a symbol as a nulled event symbol,
even if the symbol is non-nullable.
This is convenient, for example,
for automatically generated grammars.
Applications which wish to treat
it as a failure if there is an
attempt to
mark a non-nullable symbol
as a nulled event symbol,
can check for this case using
the <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nullable()</code>
method.

<p>Precomputation may return one or more events,

At this point events only occur when failure is reported,

<p>Each <code>MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE</code> event is a symbol

rule &mdash; a &ldquo;counted&rdquo; symbol.
The presence of one or more of these will cause failure

So that the programmer can fix several at once,
these failures are delayed until events are created

<p>Each <code>MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL</code> event is a nulling

Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical

So that the programmer can fix several at once,

<p><code>marpa_g_precompute()</code> is unusual in that it
is possible to treat one of its failures as &ldquo;advisory&rdquo;,
and to proceed with parsing.
If 
<code>marpa_g_precompute()</code> fails with an error code
of <code>MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE</code>,
parsing can proceed, just as it typically would for
success.
The grammar will have been precomputed, as
calling the <code>marpa_g_is_precomputed()</code> method
will confirm.
</p>
<p>Most applications, however,
will want to simply treat failure
with <code>MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE</code>,
as simply another failure,
and fix the cycles before parsing.
Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and are considered useless in current
practice.
Cycles make processing the grammar less
efficient, sometimes considerably so.
Detection of cycles is returned as failure
because that is by far the convenient thing to do
for the vast majority of applications.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Overview</h3>

<p>An archetypal application uses a recognizer to read input.
To create a recognizer, use the <code>marpa_r_new()</code> method.
When a recognizer is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
<code>marpa_r_unref()</code> method.
</p>
<p>To make a recognizer ready for input,
use the <code>marpa_r_start_input()</code> method.
</p>
<p>The recognizer starts with its current earleme
at location 0.
To read a token at the current earleme,
use the <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> call.
</p>
<p>To complete the processing of the current earleme,
and move forward to a new one,
use the <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> call.

<dd><p>Reads a token into <var>r</var>.
The token will start at the current earleme.
Libmarpa allows tokens to be ambiguous, to be of
variable length and to overlap.
<var>token_id</var> is the symbol ID of the token,
which must be a terminal.
<var>length</var> is the length of the token.
</p>
<p><var>value</var> is an
integer that represents the value of the
token.
In applications where the token&rsquo;s actual value is not an integer, it is
expected that the application will use this value as
a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; value,
perhaps finding the actual value by using <var>value</var>
to index an array.
<var>value</var> is not used inside Libmarpa &mdash; it is simply
stored to be returned by the valuator
as a convenience for the application.
Some applications may prefer to track token values on
their own, perhaps based on
the earleme location and <var>token_id</var>,
instead of using Libmarpa&rsquo;s token values.
</p>
<p>A <var>value</var> of 0 is reserved for a now-deprecated feature.
Do not use it.
For more details on that feature, see the
section <a href="#Valued-and-unvalued-symbols">Valued and unvalued symbols</a>.
</p>
<p>When <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
is successful,
the value of the furthest earleme is set to
the greater of its value before the call,
and <var>current</var>+<var>length</var>,
where <var>current</var> is the value of the current earleme.
The values of the current and latest earlemes
are unchanged by
calls to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>.
</p>
<p>Several error codes leave the recognizer in a fully
recoverable state, allowing the application to
retry the <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> method.
Retry is efficient, and quite useable as a parsing
technique.
The error code
of primary interest from this point of view
is <code>MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID</code>,
which indicates that the token was not accepted
because of its token ID.
Retry after this condition is used in several
applications,
and is called &ldquo;the Ruby Slippers technique&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The error codes
<code>MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_TOKEN</code>,
<code>MARPA_ERR_NO_TOKEN_EXPECTED_HERE</code>
and <code>MARPA_ERR_INACCESSIBLE_TOKEN</code>
also leave the recognizer in a fully recoverable
state, and may also be useable for the
Ruby Slippers or similar techniques.
At this writing,
the author knows of no applications which
attempt to recover from these errors.
</p>
<p>Return value:  On success, <code>MARPA_ERR_NONE</code>.
On failure, some other error code.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-marpa_005fr_005fearleme_005fcomplete"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>marpa_r_earleme_complete</strong> <em>(Marpa_Recognizer <var>r</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method does the final processing for the current earleme.
It then advances the current earleme by one.
Note that <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> may be called
even when no tokens have been read at the current earleme &mdash;
in the character-per-earleme input model, for example, tokens
can span many characters and, if the input is unambiguous over that
span, there will be no other tokens that start inside it.
</p>
<p>As mentioned,
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> always advances the current earleme,
incrementing its value by 1.
This means that value of the current earleme after the call
will be the one plus the value of the earleme processed by the call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
If any token was accepted at the earleme being processed,
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> creates a new Earley set
which will be the latest Earley set
and, after the call, the latest
earleme will be equal to the new current earleme.
If no token was accepted at the
earleme being processed,
no Earley set is created,
and the value of the latest earleme remains unchanged.
The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
a call to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>.
</p>
<p>During this method, one or more events may occur.
On success, this function returns the number of events
generated,
but it is important to note that events may be
created whether earleme completion fails or succeeds.
When this method fails,
the application must call <code>marpa_g_event()</code>
if it wants to determine if any events occurred.
Since the reason for failure to complete an earleme is often
detailed in the events, applications that fail will often
be at least as interested in the events as those
that succeed.
</p>
<p>The <code>MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD</code> event
indicates that an application-settable threshold
on the number of Earley items has been reached or exceeded.
What this means depends on the application,
but when the default threshold is exceeded,
it means that it is very likely
that the time and space resources consumed by
the parse will prove excessive.
</p>
<p>A parse is &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; when it can accept no more
input.
This can happen both on success and on failure.
Note that the failure due to parse exhaustion
only means failure
at the current earleme.
There may be successful parses
at earlier earlemes.
</p>
<p>If a parse is exhausted, but successful,
an event with the event code
<code>MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED</code> occurs.
Because the parse is exhausted,
no input will be accepted at later earlemes.
It is quite common for a parse to become exhausted
when it succeeds.
Many practical grammars are designed so that a
successful parse cannot be extended.
</p>
<p>An exhausted parse may cause a failure,
in which case
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> returns an
error
whose error code is <code>MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED</code>.
For a parse to fail at an earleme due to exhaustion,
it must be the case that no alternatives were
accepted at that earleme.
In fact,
in the standard input model,
a failure due to parse exhaustion
occurs if and only if
no alternatives
were accepted at the current earleme.
</p>
<p>The circumstances under which
failure due to parse exhaustion occurs
are slightly more complicated
when variable length tokens are in use.
Informally,
a parse will never fail due to exhaustion as long
as it is possible that a token
ending at some future
earleme will continue the parse.
More precisely,
a call to 
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> fails
due to parse exhaustion
if and only if, first,
no alternatives were added at the current earleme
and, second,
that call left the current
earleme equal to the furthest earleme.
</p>
<p>Return value:  On success, the number of events generated.
On failure, -2.

<var>set_id</var>,

</p>
<p>At this writing, there is no method for
the inverse operation (conversion of an earleme to an Earley set
ID).
One consideration in writing
such a method is that not all earlemes correspond to Earley sets.
Applications that want to map earlemes
to Earley sets will have no trouble if they
are using the standard input model &mdash;
the Earley set
ID is always exactly equal to the earleme in that model.
For other applications
that want an earleme-to-ID mapping,
the most general method is create an ID-to-earleme
array using the <code>marpa_r_earleme()</code> method
and invert it.

</p>
<p>The &ldquo;value&rdquo; and &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; of an Earley set are
an arbitrary integer
and an arbitrary pointer
that the application
can use for its own purposes.
In character-per-earleme input models, for example,
the integer can be the codepoint of the current character.
In a traditional token-per-earleme input model,

<hr>
<a name="Value-overview"></a>
<a name="Overview-5"></a>
<h3 class="section">17.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The archetypal application needs
a value object (or <em>valuator</em>) to produce
the value of the parse.
To create a valuator, use the <code>marpa_v_new()</code> method.
When a valuator is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the 
<code>marpa_v_unref()</code> method.
</p>
<p>The application is required to maintain the stack,
and the application is also required to implement
most of the semantics, including the evaluation
of rules.
Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator provides instructions to
the application on how to manipulate the stack.
To iterate through this series of instructions,
use the <code>marpa_v_step()</code> method.
</p>
<p><code>marpa_v_step()</code> returns the type
of step.
Most step types have values associated with them.
To access these values use the methods
described in the section <a href="#Basic-step-accessors">Basic step accessors</a>.
How to perform the steps is described in
the sections
<a href="#How-to-use-the-valuator">How to use the valuator</a>
and <a href="#Stepping-through-the-valuator">Stepping through the valuator</a>.

<a name="How-to-use-the-valuator-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">17.2 How to use the valuator</h3>
<p>Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator provides the application with
&ldquo;steps&rdquo;, which are
instructions for stack manipulation.
Libmarpa itself does not maintain a stack.
This leaves the upper layer in total control of the
stack and the values which are placed on it.
</p>
<p>As example may make this clearer.
Suppose the evalution is at a place in the parse tree
where an addition is being performed.
Libmarpa does not know that the operation
is an addition.
It will tell the application that rule number <var>R</var>
is to be applied to the arguments at stack locations
<var>N</var> and <var>N</var>+1, and that the result is to placed in
stack location <var>N</var>.
</p>
<p>In this system
the application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule <var>R</var> and determines that it
is an addition.
The application can do this by using <var>R</var> as an index
into an array of callbacks, or by any other method
it chooses.
Let&rsquo;s assume a callback implements the semantics
for rule <var>R</var>.
Libmarpa has told the application that two arguments
are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations <var>N</var> and <var>N</var>+1 in the stack.
They might be the numbers 42 and 711.
So the callback is called with its two arguments,
and produces a return value, let&rsquo;s say, 753.
Libmarpa has told the application that the result
belongs at location <var>N</var> in the stack,
so the application writes 753 to location <var>N</var>.
</p>
<p>Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics,
the operation for rule R could be string concatenation
instead of addition.
Or, if it is addition, it could allow for its arguments
to be floating point or complex numbers.
Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers,
strings, complex numbers, or polymorphic objects which are
capable of being any of these things and more.

<h3 class="section">17.3 Advantages of step-driven valuation</h3>

<p>Step-driven valuation
hides Libmarpa&rsquo;s grammar rewrites from the application,
and is quite efficient.
Libmarpa knows which rules are sequences.
Libmarpa optimizes stack manipulations based on this knowledge.
Long sequences
are very common in practical grammars.
For these,
the stack manipulations suggested by Libmarpa&rsquo;s
step-driven valuator
will be significantly faster than the
traditional stack evaluation algorithm.
</p>
<p>Step-driven evalution has another advantage.
To illustrate this,
consider what is a very common case:
The semantics are implemented in a higher-level language,
using callbacks.
If Libmarpa did not use step-driven valuation,
it would need to provide for this case.
But for generality,
Libmarpa would have to deal in C callbacks.
Therefore, a middle layer would have to create C language wrappers
for the callbacks in the higher level language.
</p>
<p>The implementation that results is this:
The higher level language would need to wrap each callback in C.
When calling Libmarpa, it would pass the wrappered callback.
Libmarpa would then need to call the C language &ldquo;wrappered&rdquo; callback.
Next, the wrapper would call the higher-level language callback.
The return value,
which would be data native to the higher-level language,
would need to be passed to the C language wrapper,
which will need to make arrangements for it to be based
back to the higher-level language when appropriate.
</p>
<p>A setup like this is not terribly efficient.
And exception handling across language boundaries would be
very tricky.
But neither of these is the worst problem.
</p>
<p>Callbacks are hard to debug.
Wrappered callbacks are even worse.
Calls made across language boundaries
are harder yet to debug.
In the system described above,
by the time a return value is finally consumed,
a language boundary will have been crossed four times.
</p>
<p>How do
programmers deal with difficulties like this?
Usually, by
doing the absolute minimum possible in the callbacks.
A horrific debugging enviroment can become a manageable
one if there is next to no code to be debugged.
And this can be accomplished by
doing as much as possible in pre- and post-processing.
</p>
<p>In essence, callbacks force applications to do most
of the programming
via side effects.
One need not be a functional programming purist to find
this a very undesirable style of design to force on
an application.
But the ability to debug can make the difference between
code that does work and code that does not.
Unfairly or not,
code is rarely considered well-designed when it does
not work.
</p>
<p>So, while step-driven valuation seems
a roundabout approach,
it is simpler and more direct than
the likely alternatives.
And there is something to be said for pushing
semantics up to the higher levels &mdash;
they can be expected to know more about it.
</p>
<p>These advantages of step-driven valuation
are strictly in
the context of a low-level interface.
The author is under no illusion
that direct use of Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator will be found
satisfactory by most application programmers,
even those using the C language.
The author certainly avoids using step-driven valuation directly.
Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator is intended
to be used via an upper layer,
one which <strong>does</strong> know about semantics.

<a name="Maintaining-the-stack"></a>
<a name="Maintaining-the-stack-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">17.4 Maintaining the stack</h3>

<p>This section discusses in detail the requirements
for maintaining the stack.
In some cases,
such as implementation using a Perl array,
fulfilling these requirements is trivial.
Perl auto-extends its arrays,
and initializes the element values,
on every read or write.
For the C programmer,
things are not quite so easy.
</p>
<p>In this section,
we will assume a C90 or C99 standard-conformant
C application.
This assumption is convenient on two grounds.
First, this will be the intended use
for many readers.
Second, standard-conformant C is
a &ldquo;worst case&rdquo;.
Any issue faced by a programmer of another environment
is likely to also be one that must be solved
by the C programmer.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa often
optimizes away unnecessary stack writes
to stack locations.
When it does so, it will not
necessarily optimize away all reads
to that stack location.
This means that a location&rsquo;s first access,
as suggested by the Libmarpa step instructions,
may be a read.
This possibility
requires a special awareness from the C
programmer,
as discussed in
the sections
<a href="#Sizing-the-stack">Sizing the stack</a> and
<a href="#Initializing-locations-in-the-stack">Initializing locations in the stack</a>.
</p>
<p>In the discussions in this document,
stack locations are non-negative integers.
The bottom of the stack is location 0.
In moving from the bottom of the stack to the top,
the numbers increase.
Stack location <var>Y</var> is said to be &ldquo;greater&rdquo; 
than stack location <var>X</var> if stack location
<var>Y</var> is closer to the top of stack than location <var>X</var>,
and therefore stack locations are considered greater or
lesser if the integers that represent them are
greater or lesser.
Another way to state that
a stack location <var>Y</var> is greater (lesser)
than stack location <var>X</var> is to say that
a stack location <var>Y</var> is later (earlier)
than stack location <var>X</var>.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Sizing-the-stack"></a>
<a name="Sizing-the-stack-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">17.4.1 Sizing the stack</h4>

<p>If an implementation applies Libmarpa&rsquo;s step
instructions literally, using a physical stack,
it must make sure the stack is large enough.
Specifically, the application must do the following
</p>
<ul>
<li> Ensure location 0 exists &mdash; in other
words that the stack is at least length 1.
</li><li> For <code>MARPA_STEP_TOKEN</code> steps,
ensure that location <code>marpa_v_result(v)</code>
exists.
</li><li> For <code>MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL</code> steps,
ensure that location <code>marpa_v_result(v)</code>
exists.
</li><li> For <code>MARPA_STEP_RULE</code> steps,
ensure that stack locations from <code>marpa_v_arg_0(v)</code>
to <code>marpa_v_arg_n(v)</code> exist.
</li></ul>

<p>Three aspects of these requirements deserve special mention.
First,
note that the requirement for a
<code>MARPA_STEP_RULE</code> is that the application
size the stack to include the arguments to be
read.
Because stack writes may be optimized away,
an application,
when reading,
cannot assume
that the stack was
sized appropriately by a prior write.
The first access to a new stack location may be
a read.
</p>
<p>Second,
note that there is no explicit requirement that
the application size the stack to include the
location for the result of the
<code>MARPA_STEP_RULE</code> step.
An application is allowed to assume that
result will go into one of the locations
that were read.
</p>
<p>Third, special note should be made of the requirement
that location 0 exist.
By convention, the parse result resides
in location 0 of the stack.
Because of potential optimizations,
an application cannot assume that it
will receive a Libmarpa step instruction that
either reads from or writes to location 0.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Initializing-locations-in-the-stack"></a>
<a name="Initializing-locations-in-the-stack-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">17.4.2 Initializing locations in the stack</h4>

<p>Write optimizations also creates issues for implementations
which require data to be initialized before reading.
Every fully standard-conforming C application is such an
implementation.
Both C90 and C99 allow &ldquo;trap values&rdquo;,
and therefore conforming applications must be
prepared for
an uninitialized location to contain one of those.
Reading a trap value may cause an abend.
(It is safe, in standard-conforming C, to write to a location
containing a trap value.)
</p>
<p>The requirement that locations be initialized before
reading occurs in other implementations.
Any implementation that has a &ldquo;universe&rdquo; of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; values,
may require special precautions.
The required precautions may amount to a need to initialize
&ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo; values.
A practical example might be an implementation that expects
all locations to contain a pointer which it can safely indirect
from.
In such implementations,
just as in standard-conformant C,
every stack location
needs to be initialized before being read.
</p>
<p>Due to write optimizations, an application
cannot rely on Libmarpa&rsquo;s step instructions to
initialize every stack location before its first read.
One way to safely deal with the
initialization of stack locations,
is to do all of the following:
</p><ul>
<li> When starting evaluation, ensure that the stack contains at least location 0.
</li><li> Also, when starting evaluation, initialize every location in the stack.
</li><li> Whenever the stack is extended,
initialize every stack location added.
</li></ul>

<p>Applications which try to optimize out some of
these initializations
need to be aware that
an application can never assume that activity in
the stack is safely &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; an uninitialized location.
Libmarpa steps often revisit earlier sections of the stack,
and these revisits may include reads of previously
unvisited stack locations.

problems of implementation arise.
At a minimum, a sequence with counted nullables
would be wildly
ambigious.
</p>
<p>Sequence rules are simply an optimized shorthand
for rules that can also be written in ordinary BNF.
If the equivalent of a sequence of nullables is
really what your application needs,

<h3 class="section">19.4 Internal error codes</h3>

<p>An internal error code may be one of two things:
First,
it can be an error code which
arises from an internal Libmarpa programming issue
(in other words, something happening in the code
that was not supposed to be able to happen.)
Second, it can be an error code which only occurs
when a method from Libmarpa&rsquo;s internal interface
is used.
Both kinds of internal error message share one common
trait &mdash; users of the Libmarpa&rsquo;s external interface
should never see them.
</p>
<p>Internal error messages
require someone with knowledge of the Libmarpa internals
to follow up on them.
They usually do not have descriptions or suggested messages.

<h3 class="section">20.1 Why so many time objects?</h3>

<p>Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.
Marpa achieves its efficiency,
not in spite of making multiple
passes over the data, but because of it.
Marpa regularly substitutes
two fast O(<var>n</var>) passes for a single
O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) pass.
Marpa&rsquo;s proliferation of time objects is in
keeping with its multi-pass approach.
</p>
<p>Bocage objects come at no cost,
even for unambiguous parses,
because the same pass which creates the bocage
also deals with other issues which are of major
significance for unambiguous parses.
It is the post-processing of the bocage pass
that enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.
</p>
<p>Of the various objects, the best
case for elimination is of the
ordering object.
In many cases, the ordering is trivial.
Either the parse is unambiguous, or the
application does not care about the order in
which parses are returned.
But while it would be easy to add an option
to bypass creation of an ordering object,
there is little to be gained from it.
When the ordering is trivial,
its overhead is very small &mdash;
essentially a handful of subroutine calls.
Many orderings accomplish nothing,
but these cost next to nothing.
</p>
<p>Tree objects come at minimal cost to unambiguous grammars,
because the same pass that allows iteration through multiple
parse trees does the tree traversal.
This eliminates much of the work that otherwise would
need to be done in
the valuation time object.
In the current implement, the valuation time object
needs only to step through a sequence already determined
in the tree iterator.

<h3 class="section">20.2 Numbered objects</h3>

<p>As the name suggests,
the choice was made to implement
numbered objects as integers,
and not as
pointers.
In standard-conformant C,
integers can be safely checked for validity,
while pointers cannot.
</p>
<p>There are efficiency tradeoffs between pointers and
integers but they are complicated,
and they go both ways.
Pointers can be faster, but integers can be used
as indexes into more than one data structure.
Which is actually faster depends on the design.
Integers allow for a more flexible design,
so that once the choice is settled on,
careful programming can make them a win,
possibly a very big one.
</p>
<p>The approach taken in Libmarpa was to settle,
from the outset,
on integers as the implementation for numbered
objects,
and to optimize on that basis.
The author concedes that it is
possible that
others redoing Libmarpa from scratch
might find that pointers are faster.
But the author is confident
that they will also discover,
on modern architectures,
that the lack of safe validity checking
is far too high a price to pay
for the difference in speed.

<h3 class="section">20.3 LHS terminals</h3>

<p>Marpa&rsquo;s idea
in losing the sharp division between terminals
and non-terminals is that the distinction,
while helpful for proving theorems,
is not essential in practice.
LHS symbols
in the input might be useful for
&ldquo;short circuiting&rdquo; the rules in which they occur.
This may
prove helpful in debugging, or have other applications.
</p>
<p>However,
it also can be useful,
for checking input validity as well as for efficiency,
to follow tradition and distinguish
non-terminals from terminals.
For this reason,
the traditional behavior is the default
in Libmarpa.

<h4 class="subsection">22.1.1 What unvalued symbols were</h4>

<p>Libmarpa symbols can have values,
which is the traditional way of doing semantics.
Libmarpa also allows symbols to be unvalued.
An <em>unvalued</em> symbol is one whose value
is unpredictable from instance to instance.
If a symbol is unvalued, we sometimes say that it
has &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; semantics.
</p>
<p>Situations where the semantics can tolerate unvalued symbols
are surprisingly frequent.
For example, the top-level of many languages is a series
of major units, all of whose semantics are typically accomplished
via side effects.
The compiler is typically indifferent to the actual value produced
by these major units, and tracking them is a waste of time.
Similarly, the value of the separators in a list is typically
ignored.
</p>
<p>Rules are unvalued if and only if their LHS symbols
are unvalued.
When rules and symbols are unvalued,
Libmarpa optimizes their evaluation.
</p>
<p>It is in principle unsafe to check the value 
of a symbol if it can be unvalued.
For this reason,
once a symbol has been treated as valued,
Libmarpa marks it as valued.
Similarly,
once a symbol has been treated as unvalued,
Libmarpa marks it as unvalued.
Once marked, a symbol&rsquo;s valued status is
<em>locked</em> and cannot be changed later.
</p>
<p>The valued status of terminals is marked the first
time they are read.
The valued status of LHS symbols must be explicitly
marked by the application when initializing the
valuator &mdash; this is Libmarpa&rsquo;s equivalent of
registering a callback.
</p>
<p>LHS terminals are disabled by default.
If allowed, the user should be aware that the valued
status of a LHS terminal
will be locked in the recognizer
if it is used as a terminal,
and the symbol&rsquo;s use as a rule LHS
in the valuator must be
consistent with the recognizer&rsquo;s marking.
</p>
<p>Marpa reports an error when a symbol&rsquo;s use
conflicts with its locked valued status.
Doing so usually saves the programmer
some tricky debugging further down the road.

<p>By default, Libmarpa&rsquo;s valuator objects

non-terminal symbols have
no semantics.
The archetypal application will need to register
